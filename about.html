          <h2 class="centred">My Studies</h2>
          <p>
            I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of Sydney.
            Throughout my academic journey, I extensively studied software design and testing, database management, 
            agile methodologies, artificial intelligence and data science.
            In 2020, I participated in the Microsoft Student Accelerator Program, where I engaged in a series 
            of workshops and competitions. Notably, I achieved success as a winner in their second bootcamp, where I created a program leveraging 
            Azure IOT Hub and Stream Analytics. This involved transmitting data to be visualised in Power BI, 
            showcasing my proficiency in utilising Microsoft's cutting-edge technologies.
          </p>
          <h2 class="centred">My Work</h2>
          <p>
            I have two years of experience at EY as a technology consultant. My initial assignment involved working
            as a data engineer at a prominent Australian insurance company. In this role, I utilised Python, Spark
            and SQL to develop complex data transformations and thoroughly test and validate the client's data. 
            I collaborated with subject matter experts and team members to create data mappings and logic from source to target. 
            Additionally, I facilitated Scrum activities and documented technical mappings to align with the client's business glossaries.
            <br><br>Later on, I transitioned to my second project, serving as a Technical Business Analyst at a Big 4 Australian bank.
            In this capacity, I facilitated workshops in collaboration with domain architects and business stakeholders to define
            requirements, and I refined and groomed backlogs in preparation for each sprint, ensuring clarity and effectiveness 
            throughout the development process.<br><br> Beyond my project responsibilities, I actively participated in EY's Women in Tech group,
            where I organised and facilitated book club events. Additionally, I had the opportunity to co-facilitate a workshop focussed on Cloud technologies.
            As part of my commitment to continuous growth and learning, I pursued upskilling opportunities, expanding my knowledge
            in areas such as Kafka, Airflow, Azure and AWS. Notably, I obtained my Azure AZ-900 certification in Azure Fundamentals. 
  
          </p>
        <h2 class="centred">Upskilling and Beyond</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to my continuous growth at EY, I have been actively pursuing more upskilling opportunities by immersing myself in  
          all things related to full-stack development. This includes diving into React, JavaScript, Express, and Node, and 
          applying and honing my skills in these areas. I have successfully completed several projects that showcase my
          capabilities. Feel free to explore them on my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page!
